# LittleMaidMobEnhanced

LittleMaidMob is a mod that adds LittleMaids to your world that you can hire to do a variety of tasks for you.

This Fork of LittleMaidMob is called "Enhanced" because it is dedicated to be more stable and compatible than the other forks. The goal is to fix minor annoyances and add resonable features requested by its followers. I also hope to add features that appear in [LMMNX](https://github.com/Verclene/LittleMaidMobNX) and [LMRE](https://github.com/Verclene/LittleMaidReengaged) while changing them to fit the mod the way I see it. At this point developement will continue to be done on 1.7.10 until the [poll on the forum page](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/2656647-1-7-10-littlemaidmob-enhanced-now-with-add-on) shows a large majority of players prefering 1.8.9. 1.9.4 support will probably become an option for the poll added when [Verclene](https://github.com/Verclene) moves [LMRE](https://github.com/Verclene/LittleMaidReengaged) to 1.10 and drops 1.9 support.

Note: If you are moving to Enhanced from another version, make sure to backup your world before trying this version. I'm not responsible for any damages caused by this mod.
