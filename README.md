# LittleMaidMobEnhanced

The LittleMaidMob mod for Minecraft is a very fun and useful mod that for many versions has been plauged with incompatabilities and various other bugs that limit it to just another mob mod. This project hopes to change LittleMaidMob into fully functioning mod, one that adds the aspects of automation than one could make in Tekkit only in the form of a follower.
