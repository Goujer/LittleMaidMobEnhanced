Notes: 

The hair braids on the redhead(Megumi) belong to a separate armor texture I made from the KemonoMdl add on. It's a little inconvenient but I wanted to be consistent and use the VUD1 model for all of the textures. 

One problem I've noticed with this hybrid is that the Kemono model has a different head tilt from the other models I've seen so far. This will only occur when you hold out sugar on a tamed maid, so it shouldn't become a major problem.

The same goes for the bunny ears and tail on Rize.

Finally, the kimono arms on the girls in green belong to the Shion model from the MutliModelSet. As far as I know it's still unavailable in Minecraft 1.6.4.
